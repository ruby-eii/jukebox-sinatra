This project contains the exercises for the ruby@uniovi workshop (day 2).

ruby@uniovi is a 2-day workshop which will be held in the University of Oviedo (Spain), from 4th to 6th March 2015.

## Hack it!

The recommended way to work with this sample app is within the ruby@uniovi virtualized development environment.

Refer to http://github.com/ruby-uniovi/rubyeii for installation instructions.

Workshop participants could experience how it feels to work as a professional web developer for a few hours while completing the User Stories provided in this [Trello board].

## Roadmap / Support

This software has been created exclusively for educational purposes.

Workshop materials are under active development, so... use them at your own perice and let us know how it goes :)
