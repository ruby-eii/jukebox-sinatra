This project contains the exercises for the ruby@uniovi workshop (day 2).

ruby@uniovi is a 2-day workshop which will be held in the University of Oviedo (Spain), from 4th to 6th March 2015.

## Play with it!

Our recommended way to play with this sample app is through the ruby@uniovi development machine.

Refer to http://github.com/ruby-uniovi/rubyeii for installation instructions.

You'll happily have a brand-new Vagrant box with all the workshop material already packed ;)

## Roadmap / Support

This software has been created exclusively for educational purposes.

It's still under active development, so use it at your own perice and be happy about sharing that with us! :)
