This project contains the exercises for the ruby@uniovi workshop (day 2).

## Play with it!

Our recommended way to play with this sample app is through the ruby@uniovi development machine.

Refer to http://github.com/ruby-uniovi/rubyeii for installation instructions.

You'll happily have a brand-new Vagrant box with all the workshop material already packed ;)

## Roadmap / Support

This code and notes have been created exclusively for educational purposes, being this repo as a useful resource, allowing the students to interact with it.

ruby@uniovi is a 2-day workshop which will be held beetween 4th & 6th of March in the University of Oviedo, Spain.
So, nowadays, workshop materials are currently under development.

Use it at your own perice and be happy about sharing that with us! :)
